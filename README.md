## Updating: Instructions & Changes

### 1.3

***Please Remove 'Better Wards'.*** We didn't use it so I have uninstalled from the server.

I added a farming skill mod because it has a really great grid placement feature that prevents placing crops where they cannot grow. The hotkeys are **'LeftControl' for toggling of snapping to a grid**, and **'LeftShift' for toggling planting multiple.**
