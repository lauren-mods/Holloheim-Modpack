This is a modpack for a private server. It contains lots of config files, so download at your own risk!

## Updating Instructions & Changes

### 2.3.2

Some config changes and updates including but not limited to:  

- In cheat mode (devcommands) the console command alias `repair10` repairs all objects within a 10m radius.
- Quick ping hotkeys are 't' for live ping and 'g' for pinning on the map. They ping what you are looking at (crosshairs). Changing the hotkeys is not advised as it seems to bug.

### 2.3.1

removed mass farming which was not backwards compatible with hearth and home

### 2.3

lots of changes, mostly getting ready for mistlands compatibility

### 2.2 (8/11/22)

- changed the hotkey for moving the inventory panels around from LeftCtrl to LeftAlt (because keep moving by accident)
- Farming mod is back (yay). Character progress will have been reset, so use the (devcommands) command: `raiseskill farming [amount]` e.g. `raiseskill farming 20` to restore progress.
- Please ***uninstall*** MassFarming

### 2.1 (29/10/22)

#### 2.1.2 reupload

(2.1.1 failed to upload)

#### 2.1.1 fixes a small mistake

If you did not install 2.0, then please do a clean install (as instructed in 2.0). If you installed 2.0, then you only need to update.

- Plant everything is back, yay
- Server Dev Commands is also back
- Added a surprise mod for the mountain age... (don't look at your list if you don't want spoilers)
- Keeping the no raids mod, so please disable in mod manager before playing together

### 2.0 (28/10/22)

Install with a CLEAN profile as many changes have been made.  

- Removed all mods that are currently not working with patch 0.211.11 (those that use ServerSync).
- Downgraded to an old version of Hearthstone. RESET YOUR HEARTHSTONE POINT. Hearthstones in this version must be crafted at a workbench.
- Replaced Farming with MassFarming as it works with patch and has a similar grid feature.
- Added a no raids mod. This is for playing solo as we can't use the devcommand 'stopevent'. DISABLE the mod in mod manager when playing together.
- Carts can now be repaired & built without a workbench.

### 1.5 (19/10/22)

Upload error with 1.4

### 1.4 (19/10/22)

Fix manifest mistake

### 1.3 (19/10/22)

***Please Remove 'Better Wards'.*** We didn't use it so I have uninstalled from the server.

#### The modpack will add these mods, please check the [Hotkeys & Commands](#hotkeys--commands-list) section for new hotkeys, and the mod pages (linked) for more info.

### Precise Piece Placement (PPP)
