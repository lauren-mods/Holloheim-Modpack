This is a modpack for a private server. It contains lots of config files, so download at your own risk!

## Updating Instructions & Changes

### 1.3 (19/10/22)

***Please Remove 'Better Wards'.*** We didn't use it so I have uninstalled from the server.

#### The modpack will add these mods, please check the [Hotkeys & Commands](#hotkeys--commands-list) section for new hotkeys, and the mod pages (linked) for more info.
